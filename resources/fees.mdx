| Platform | Trade Fee | Approval Gas | Hidden Fees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ApeNinja** | 0.5% | ‚ùå No separate approval | ‚ùå None |
| DEXs | 0.3‚Äì1% + gas | ‚úÖ Required per token | ‚ùå None |
| Aggregators | 0.1‚Äì0.5% + gas | ‚úÖ Required per token | ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible backend fees |

### Understanding Our Fee Structure

ApeNinja charges a flat 0.5% fee on all trades. This fee:

- Is deducted directly from the trade amount
- Includes all services (no separate platform or subscription fees)
- Applies consistently across all supported chains
- Is the same regardless of trade size

<Note>
  Unlike traditional DEXs, ApeNinja **does not** require separate approval transactions. This saves you gas costs and time, especially when trading new tokens.
</Note>

## Cost Comparison Example

Let's compare the total cost of trading 1 ETH for USDT across different platforms:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ApeNinja">
    **Trade Fee:** 0.5% of 1 ETH = 0.005 ETH<br />
    **Approval Fee:** $0 (included in single transaction)<br />
    **Total Cost:** 0.005 ETH (approximately $15 at $3,000/ETH)
    
    **Transaction Count: 1**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Traditional DEX">
    **Trade Fee:** 0.3% of 1 ETH = 0.003 ETH<br />
    **Approval Gas:** ~$5-15 (varies by network congestion)<br />
    **Swap Gas:** ~$10-30 (varies by network congestion)<br />
    **Total Cost:** 0.003 ETH + $15-45 gas (approximately $24-60 at $3,000/ETH)
    
    **Transaction Count: 2**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Aggregator">
    **Trade Fee:** 0.1% of 1 ETH = 0.001 ETH<br />
    **Backend Fee:** ~0.2% (often hidden) = 0.002 ETH<br />
    **Approval Gas:** ~$5-15 (varies by network congestion)<br />
    **Swap Gas:** ~$15-40 (aggregators use more complex routes)<br />
    **Total Cost:** 0.003 ETH + $20-55 gas (approximately $29-64 at $3,000/ETH)
    
    **Transaction Count: 2**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

As you can see, ApeNinja often provides better overall value, especially when:
- Gas prices are high
- You're trading new tokens that require approvals
- You value your time (fewer transactions = faster execution)

## One-Time Deployment Costs

When using ApeNinja for the first time on each chain, you'll need to deploy your SuperAccount. This is a one-time cost:

| Chain | Approximate Deployment Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Ethereum | 0.01-0.02 ETH (varies with gas prices) |
| Arbitrum | 0.0005-0.001 ETH equivalent |
| Base | 0.0005-0.001 ETH equivalent |
| BSC | 0.001-0.002 BNB |
| Sonic | 0.0001-0.0003 ETH equivalent |
| Berachain | 0.0001-0.0003 BERA |
| Solana | No deployment needed |

<Warning>
  Deployment costs vary based on network congestion. The above figures are estimates under normal conditions.
