## 🔩 Core Components

### 🧩 CoreTrading Contracts
These contracts handle all trade execution and routing logic across supported EVM chains.

- Abstracts routing and DEX logic
- Handles approvals, swaps, position controls
- Flexible pool ID routing

### 🧬 Strategy Contracts
Plug into specific DEXs, yield vaults, or aggregators via pool IDs.

| Pool ID | Strategy Type |
|--------|----------------|
| `0` | Aggregator (Odos, Paraswap) |
| `1` | Uniswap V2 |
| `2` | SushiSwap |
| `3` | Yield Vaults |
| `4` | NFT Marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea) |

### 🔐 SuperAccount Smart Wallets
- Deploy once per chain
- Control everything with one key
- Supports Jeet/AntiJeet, slippage, and validations

### 🧠 API Layer
- Powers the Telegram bot, Chrome extension, Web App, and Twitter bot
- Unified REST interface for wallet, trading, and data endpoints
