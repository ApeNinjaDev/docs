# üì¶ Contract Architecture

> **ApeNinja's blockchain foundation consists of a sophisticated, modular contract ecosystem designed for cross-chain compatibility and strategic upgradeability.**

## üß± Core Contract Infrastructure

| Contract Component | Functional Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `CoreTrading` | Primary execution router orchestrating all trade operations |
| `SuperAccountFactory` | Enterprise-grade deployment engine for user-specific SuperAccount instantiation |
| `Aggregator` | Strategic management of pool ID 0 routing (Odos, Paraswap, specialized aggregators) |
| `DEX Strategies` | Protocol-specific implementation logic for Uniswap, SushiSwap, and other liquidity venues |

## üõ†Ô∏è Multi-Chain Deployment Matrix

All supported networks maintain consistent contract architecture with chain-specific deployments:

- **Base**: Full implementation of core contract suite
- **Arbitrum**: Complete deployment with optimized gas configurations
- **BSC**: Strategic implementation with BSC-specific optimizations
- **Sonic**: Comprehensive deployment tailored to Sonic's execution environment
- **Berachain**: Complete integration with Berachain-specific enhancements

**Solana Exception**: Utilizes direct Jupiter DEX integration pathway instead of traditional contract deployment, enabling native Solana execution without EVM compatibility requirements.

*All contract deployments undergo rigorous security auditing and performance optimization for their respective blockchain environments.*
