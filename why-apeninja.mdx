## üß† The ApeNinja Advantage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="‚ö° One-Click Execution">
    Trade instantly across chains. Approval + swap in one go.
    
    With traditional DEXs, you need to:

    2. Wait for confirmation
    3. Execute the swap (transaction #2)
    
    With ApeNinja, you do all of this in a single transaction, saving time and gas fees.
