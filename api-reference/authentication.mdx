# Authentication

ApeNinja uses a passwordless authentication system that is both secure and convenient. The authentication flow involves:

1. Initiating the authentication process with your email
2. Verifying your identity with a one-time password (OTP) sent to your email
3. Receiving a JWT token and API key for future authentication

## Authentication Methods

Once authenticated, you can use either:

- **JWT Token**: A short-lived token returned during the authentication process
- **API Key**: A long-lived key sent to your email that can be used for persistent access

## Security Recommendations

- Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code
- Consider using environment variables to manage API keys
- Regenerate your API key immediately if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) when communicating with our API

## Important Note on Wallet Export

While we provide an endpoint to export your wallet private keys, please be aware that:

⚠️ **Accounts that have exported their keys will be ineligible for certain upcoming features** including auto bridging and sponsored buys.

We recommend using the export feature only when absolutely necessary and handling the exported keys with the utmost security precautions.
