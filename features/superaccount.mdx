# ðŸ§™ SuperAccount Magic

> Smart contract wallet. One-time deploy. Infinite gains.

SuperAccount is the heart of ApeNinja's technology, enabling lightning-fast trades and enhanced security across all supported blockchains.

## What is SuperAccount?

SuperAccount is a smart contract wallet that acts as your personal trading assistant on each blockchain. Unlike traditional EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets, SuperAccounts are programmable, allowing for advanced features that aren't possible with standard wallets.

<Note>
  You only need to deploy a SuperAccount once per blockchain. After that, all your trades on that chain will be faster, cheaper, and more secure.
</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="One-Time Deployment">
    When you first use ApeNinja on a new blockchain, we'll prompt you to deploy your SuperAccount. This is a one-time gas cost per chain.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Token Transfer">
    Transfer tokens to your SuperAccount from your existing wallet or via our fiat on-ramp partners.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trade Execution">
    When you execute a trade, your SuperAccount handles the entire process:
    
    1. Validates the transaction for security
    2. Approves token spending (if needed)
    3. Executes the swap via the optimal route
    4. Protects against MEV attacks
    
    All in a single transaction!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Deep Dive

SuperAccount is built on the Account Abstraction (AA) paradigm, which is becoming the standard for next-generation wallets in the blockchain ecosystem.

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity SuperAccount
  // Simplified example of our SuperAccount contract
  contract SuperAccount {
      address public owner;
      address public coreTrading;
      
      constructor(address _owner, address _coreTrading) {
          owner = _owner;
          coreTrading = _coreTrading;
      }
      
      // Execute a trade in a single transaction
      function executeTradeWithApproval(
          address tokenIn,
          address tokenOut,
          uint256 amountIn,
          uint256 poolId
      ) external onlyOwner {
          // Approve token spending
          IERC20(tokenIn).approve(coreTrading, amountIn);
          
          // Execute the trade
          ICoreTrading(coreTrading).executeTrade(
              tokenIn,
              tokenOut,
              amountIn,
              poolId
          );
      }
      
      // Other utility functions...
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Usage
  // Example of how to use SuperAccount from our SDK
  const account = new SuperAccount({
    chainId: 1,  // Ethereum
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  });
  
  // Execute a trade with a single transaction
  await account.trade({
    tokenIn: 'USDT',
    tokenOut: 'ETH',
    amountIn: '100',  // 100 USDT
    slippage: 0.5     // 0.5% slippage
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Measures

SuperAccount includes multiple layers of security:

1. **Scoped Approvals**: Tokens are only approved for the exact amount needed
2. **Transaction Validation**: All transactions are validated before execution
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against potential exploits or attacks
4. **Owner Controls**: Only you can control your SuperAccount
